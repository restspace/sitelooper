/**
 * Rebuild a flow from a RECORDED session, offline, and fingerprint the result.
 *
 *   node bench/rebuild-flow.mjs --tag fwod25 --dir bench/results-published
 *   node bench/rebuild-flow.mjs --tag fwod25 --baseline bench/fixtures/fwod25.json
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `bench/sweep.mjs --from` already A/Bs a REPLAY-path change: it reuses an
 * earlier sweep's recording, so two runs differ only in code. Its own comment
 * states the precondition it cannot meet —
 *
 *   "A fix in the recorder, in compile, or in buildFlow changes what run 1
 *    PRODUCES and must be measured with a fresh recording."
 *
 * — and a fresh recording is model-driven, so every sweep compiles a DIFFERENT
 * procedure. That is not a control. fwod25 is what it costs: 50 minutes and
 * three runs to test one recording-path change, and the answer was unreadable,
 * because the recording bore no resemblance to fwod24's. Its flow came out with
 * zero outputs, zero cross-step references and seven literal `S00021`, and
 * nothing in it could be attributed to the change under test.
 *
 * So hold the recording constant instead of the code. A published `script.jsonl`
 * is a complete, deterministic record of one run: every instruction, every step
 * with its target and result, every report. Everything that happens AFTER the
 * model speaks — flattenComposedValues, backfillReadValues, slug, cites,
 * compile, buildFlow, lintFlowRefs — is a pure function of it. Replay that half
 * offline, in seconds, for free, against as many past recordings as we have.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT TELL YOU
 *
 * The naming ask is a live exchange: this reports which values it WOULD hold a
 * report for (`unnamedReadValues`, the real predicate), but not what a model
 * would answer. That part needs a model — one instruction of one, not a sweep.
 * Everything downstream of the answer is covered here.
 *
 * The fingerprint is deliberately the things that have actually gone wrong:
 * how many cross-step references a flow carries, what each step publishes,
 * and how many record identities are still frozen in as literals.
