/**
 * External verification of a benchmark run, against the repair-desk app's own
 * mutation log.
 *
 * The reporting rules require that success is judged from the app, never from
 * the agent's own final report — an agent that hallucinates completion should
 * score zero, and only an outside check can catch that.
 *
 * This is the sibling of `verify.mjs`, which verifies the same task shape
 * against the private app. There, objective 6 deletes the run's own records and
 * so destroys the evidence for objectives 2-5, leaving four of six objectives
 * permanently UNVERIFIABLE. The repair-desk app was built to close exactly that
 * gap: it keeps an append-only mutation log at `GET /__log`, one entry per
 * successful write with `before`, `after` and — for parts — the server-computed
 * `price`. Deleting a part does not remove the entry that created it. So here:
 *
 *   obj 1  ticket created                          verifiable, from the log
 *   obj 2  part A created, cost 100, price 125     verifiable, from the log
 *   obj 3  part B created, cost 200, price 250     verifiable, from the log
 *   obj 4  part A cost -> 150, price 187.50        verifiable, from the log
 *   obj 5  ticket reached status Ready             verifiable, from the log
 *   obj 6  parts deleted, ticket archived          verifiable, log + /__state
 *
 * All six are checked against values the app itself recorded, so a run that
 * reports a price it never saw is caught: the claimed prices are parsed out of
 * the run's `finalText` and compared against what the log says the app actually
 * computed. A run claiming 133.33 where the app recorded 125.00 is the precise
 * failure mode this benchmark exists to detect, and it is reported loudly.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH — read before quoting a pass.
 *
 * 1. The log proves the *app performed these writes*. It does not prove the
 *    agent drove them through the browser UI rather than by some other route —
 *    a direct `fetch` to `/api/tickets` produces an identical log entry. What
 *    bounds that is the harness restricting each arm to its own tool binary,
 *    not this verifier. If you loosen that restriction, these passes stop
 *    meaning what they appear to mean.
 *
 * 2. The log is cleared only by `POST /__reset`, and is otherwise cumulative
 *    across runs. Attribution to a single run therefore rests on two things:
 *    the runid embedded in every name the task creates, and whether the run was
 *    reset at its start. This reads `reset` from the run's result JSON and says
 *    so in the output; when it is false, the entries being scored may have been
 *    left by an earlier run using the same runid, and the verdict is only as
 *    trustworthy as the assumption that runids are not reused.
 *
 * 3. Ordering is checked only where it is cheap and load-bearing: the log is
 *    sequential, so objective 4's update is required to come after objective
 *    2's create (otherwise a cost of 150 could be the value the part was born
 *    with). Nothing else is ordered here — we do not check that the Ready
 *    transition preceded the deletes, that the deletes preceded the archive, or
 *    that no other client wrote to the app between this run's entries.
 *
 * 4. Objective 5 is scored as "the ticket reached Ready at some point", from an
 *    update entry, not from final state — objective 6 archives the ticket
 *    afterwards, and a later transition could move the status again. The task
 *    also asks the run to report the Ready *preconditions* it discovered; that
 *    is prose, and no external check of it is attempted.
 *
 * The `__` endpoints need no authentication, so unlike `verify.mjs` there is no
 * login step and no `APP_EMAIL`/`APP_PASSWORD` to supply. Point `APP_URL` at a
 * running app and go.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node bench/verify-repairdesk.mjs r01 [...more runids]
