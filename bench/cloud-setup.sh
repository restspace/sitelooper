# the benchmark against the neutral target app that ships in this repo.
#
# This is only possible for --target repairdesk. The other target is a private
# app behind a local mongod, which no cloud instance can reach.
#
# It does NOT run a benchmark. Runs cost money and take 10-40 minutes each, so

# Usage:
#   bench/cloud-setup.sh                 # sitelooper arm only
#   bench/cloud-setup.sh --with-arm-b    # also install agent-browser
#   bench/cloud-setup.sh --skip-browser  # a browser is already installed
#   bench/cloud-setup.sh --port 4181     # run the app somewhere else
#
#   # One box, several sweeps: bring up every target once, then reset between
#   # runs instead of re-provisioning. Repeatable.
#   bench/cloud-setup.sh --with-target odoo --with-target grafana

Run the sitelooper arm. The export is REQUIRED: --provider configures the
orchestrator only, and sitelooper's inner agent reads its own provider from
the environment (default zhipu, which has no key here):

  export SITELOOPER_PROVIDER=${provider}
  node bench/harness.mjs \\
    --arm sitelooper --target repairdesk \\
    --task bench/tasks/repairdesk-ticket-flow.md \\
    --provider ${provider} \\
    --runid ${runid} --out bench/results --reset

Then score it — this checks all six objectives against the app's own
mutation log, and fails if the run reported a price the app never computed:

  node bench/verify-repairdesk.mjs ${runid}
  node bench/score.mjs ${runid}

Notes:

  * --reset is not optional for a comparable run. It reloads the seed and
    clears the mutation log, which is what makes a run's recorded writes
    attributable to that run.
  * Parallel runs need one app each: /__reset is global to an app instance,
    so concurrent runs sharing one will reset each other mid-flight.
