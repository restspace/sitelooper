/**
 * Does this model fill in `evidence.values`? One LLM call per case, no browser,
 * no app, no sweep.
 *
 *   node bench/naming-probe.mjs --variant current --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
 *   node bench/naming-probe.mjs --all --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash --provider openrouter
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE
 *
 * The behaviour under test is a single decision: at the end of an instruction,
 * having read some values off the page, does the model put them in the report as
 * named values or leave them in the prose? Nothing about that needs a live
 * browser. bench/fixtures/recordings holds twelve real recordings across three
 * apps; each instruction in them is a case whose answer we already know, because
 * the recorded `read` steps say exactly what was on the page.
 *
 * So replay just the final report call: feed the instruction and the tool
 * calls/results the run actually made, offer the real `report` tool, and see
 * what comes back. One call per case, cents per sweep of the whole corpus,
 * about a minute. Compare that to fwod25 — 50 minutes and three cloud runs for
 * an answer that turned out to be unreadable.
 *
 * SHAPE DOMINATES WORDING — measured, with `current` held constant:
 *
 *   summary-nudge     85% of reports carried values   57% of page values named
 *   summary-nonudge   59%                             43%
 *   turns-nudge       48%                             31%
 *   turns-nonudge     11%                              8%
 *
 * Collapsing a real tool-call history into a tidy summary is worth a great deal,
 * so the first cut of this file — which did exactly that, and ended with "now
 * call the report tool" — reported 89% compliance and concluded the model was
 * willing. It was measuring its own nudge.
 *
 * But turns-nonudge is not the faithful shape either, for a subtler reason:
 * with no ask, the model mostly does not call `report` at all. It carries on
 * acting. Only 2 of 12 turns produced a report, so that row is largely counting
 * "has not finished yet", not "reported without naming". The live loop never
 * stops at one turn; it keeps going until a report arrives.
 *
 * So `turns-nudge` is the default: real turn structure, with the ask standing
 * in for the loop's persistence. `called report at all` is printed alongside
 * every score, because the two failures must never be added together again.
 *
 * WHAT IT COULD AND COULD NOT SETTLE (deepseek-v4-flash, 27 cases, 98 values)
 *
 * Wording, in turns-nudge — current 37% of values named, mechanical 37%,
 * consequence 31%, example 30%. The text that already ships is joint-best and
 * the worked-example inversion is last. Three deliberate rewrites, none better:
 * prompt phrasing is not the lever, and the ceiling is ~37%.
 *
 * The retry ask works whenever it runs — 6 or 7 of every 7 or 8 asks answered,
 * across four runs — and after mergeReportValues every report that arrived
 * carried values (100%, from 87%). But its effect on the corpus-wide score sits
 * inside run-to-run variance: the same configuration measured 48% then 52% of
 * reports filled on separate runs, which is larger than the gap being looked
 * for. This instrument cannot resolve a few points on 27 cases, and no amount
 * of re-running it will change that.
 *
 * So the retry's real value is settled LIVE, not here: `namingAsk` on the report
 * entry in script.jsonl records what was asked and whether it was answered, on
 * every instruction of every run. A single real sweep answers it with a bigger
 * n than this file can ever build.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * The message history is RECONSTRUCTED from the recording, not the exact
 * context the model saw (that is not stored). Tool results are replayed
 * verbatim, so the values are the real ones and the instruction is the real
 * one, but token-for-token this is not the original prompt.
 *
 * Local on purpose: the cloud-only rule exists so timing and cost are
 * comparable across identical hardware. This measures neither. It is a model
 * response, and a model responds the same wherever the request came from.

/**
 * The message history the model had when it called report — in one of four

 *
 * The first probe collapsed a whole instruction into one user message ending
 * "You have finished acting. Now call the report tool." That scored the current
 * prompt at 89% of reports carrying values, against 5-of-9 (fwod24) and 0-of-10
 * (fwod25) in real runs with the same model and the same wording. Two suspects
 * in that collapse, so vary them independently:
 *
 *   summary-nudge   the original probe: read results listed compactly, then a
 *                   direct instruction to report. Every value is recent, salient
 *                   and adjacent to the ask.
 *   summary-nonudge same list, no instruction to report — does the pointed ask
 *                   alone carry it?
 *   turns-nudge     the real thing: genuine assistant tool_calls and tool
 *                   results, one pair per step, so read results sit where they
 *                   really sit — scattered through a long history — plus the ask.
 *   turns-nonudge   real turns, no ask. This is what a live run looks like.
 *
 * If turns-nonudge collapses toward the live rate, the problem is where the
 * instruction sits relative to the values, not how it is phrased — and the fix
 * is to ask at REPORT time, which is what the retry ask already does.
