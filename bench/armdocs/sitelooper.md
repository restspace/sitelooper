sitelooper — agent-in-the-loop Playwright CLI

Usage:
  sitelooper do "<instruction>" [--json] [--max-turns N] [--timeout S] [--turn-timeout S] [--provider P] [--model M]
                                   [--fallback-model M | --no-escalate]
  sitelooper open <url>
  sitelooper brief <file.md> [--append]
  sitelooper note "<text>"
  sitelooper reset                       # clear the LLM conversation only (browser/cookies/briefing/notes kept)
  sitelooper peek [--selector <sel>] [--interactive]
  sitelooper script [out.spec.ts] [--title T] [--clear]   # emit a Playwright spec from the recorded actions
  sitelooper screenshot [path]
  sitelooper session list
  sitelooper stop [--all]
  sitelooper config                      # show resolved provider/model/paths
  sitelooper config set <key> <value>    # persist a default (provider, model, fallbackModel, baseUrl, apiKey)

Sizing an instruction:
  One `do` = one logical, verifiable step: a goal plus the check that it worked
  ("create a project named X, fill any required fields, submit, and report the row
  that appears"). Several UI actions inside one instruction is normal — that is the
  point of the tool.
  Too big:   several unrelated goals or assertions in one string. The agent stalls on
             planning and burns --max-turns. If a result comes back "blocked", split
             it and retry the halves.
  Too small: one click, one fill, one read. You pay for a whole agent loop to do what
             `peek` gives you for free.
  Budget:    `--timeout` defaults to 300 seconds, which is a fit for a fast app and
             marginal for a heavy one. On an app whose pages take seconds to settle
             (Odoo, Grafana), pass `--timeout 600 --max-turns 40` on any instruction
             that creates or edits a record. A `do` cut off at the timeout mid-work
             is the expensive failure: the work is half done, the recording keeps the
             instruction but has no procedure to replay for it, so EVERY later run
             pays the model to redo it. fwod35 and fwgr28 each lost 3-4 steps that
             way, at 35-50 model turns per step per replay. Raising the budget costs
             nothing on an instruction that finishes early.
  Do not drive the page by repeated `peek`/`config` polling. `peek` is for orienting
  ONCE when a `do` reports something you did not expect. If you are about to issue the
  same read a second time, issue a `do` instead.
  Name records by what is ON SCREEN — a name, a reference like S00021 — NEVER by an
  internal database id from a url ("res.partner id 44"). Instructions are recorded
  and replayed against fresh data: a name generalises, a database id is a pointer
  into THIS run's database and poisons every replay (fwod27 halted both replays on
  exactly this).

Escalation:
  When the routine model reports an instruction "blocked", it is retried once on a
  stronger fallback model, on the same live browser and history (told to verify state
  before repeating anything). Verified "failure" results are NOT retried. Disable with
  --no-escalate, or set the fallback model to "none".

Global flags:
  --session <name>   session name (default "default"; one daemon+browser per session)
  --verbose          stream the internal agent's actions + token accounting while it works
  --progress         stream the agent's actions to stderr (composes with --json)
  --headed           launch the browser with a visible window (first call only)
  --record           record the session to webm, one file per tab; paths are printed
                     on stop, which is when Playwright writes them (first call only)
  --script           record every action as a replayable Playwright step (first call
                     only); write the spec out later with "sitelooper script"
  --json             machine-readable output

Providers (presets; each field overridable by flag > env > config file):
  zhipu (default)    glm-5.2 @ api.z.ai            key: GLM_API_KEY / ZHIPU_API_KEY
  novita             deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash @ novita.ai   key: NOVITA_API_KEY
                     escalates to zai-org/glm-5.3 when blocked
  openrouter         deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash @ openrouter.ai  key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
                     escalates to z-ai/glm-5.3 when blocked
  openai             gpt-5-mini @ api.openai.com   key: OPENAI_API_KEY
  anthropic          claude-sonnet-5 @ api.anthropic.com (native Messages API, not
                     OpenAI-compatible — its own adapter)   key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

Environment:
  SITELOOPER_PROVIDER        provider preset name
  SITELOOPER_MODEL           model id override
  SITELOOPER_FALLBACK_MODEL  escalation model for blocked instructions ("none" disables)
  SITELOOPER_EXTRA_BODY      JSON merged into MAIN-model requests only (e.g. an OpenRouter
                                provider pin); the fallback tier does not inherit it
  SITELOOPER_FALLBACK_EXTRA_BODY  same, for the fallback/recovery tier
  SITELOOPER_BASE_URL        any OpenAI-compatible base URL
  SITELOOPER_API_KEY         API key (works with any provider)
  SITELOOPER_CHANNEL         browser channel (default chrome, falls back to msedge)
  SITELOOPER_HEADED=1        headed browser
  SITELOOPER_RECORD=1        record session video to <session dir>/video
  SITELOOPER_SCRIPT=1        record actions as a Playwright script (see the script command)

Exit codes: 0 instruction succeeded · 1 failed/blocked · 2 infra error
