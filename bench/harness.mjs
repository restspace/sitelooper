/**
 * Benchmark harness: one agent loop, two tools.
 *
 * The point of this file is that BOTH arms run through it unchanged. The only
 * things that differ between a sitelooper run and an agent-browser run are
 * (a) which CLI the single `run_command` tool is allowed to invoke and (b) that
 * CLI's own documentation, pasted into the system prompt. Same model, same
 * loop, same prompt scaffolding, same caching strategy, same accounting.
 *
 * Why not drive the arms from a coding agent instead: a general-purpose agent
 * harness carries its own large system prompt and tool set, which inflates
 * per-turn tokens for reasons that have nothing to do with the tool under test,
 * and its transcript is not reliably persisted for accounting. Owning the loop
 * makes every token attributable.
 *
 * The orchestrator is given a GOAL, never a pre-decomposed list of steps.
 * Decomposition is exactly the work that sitelooper moves off the expensive
 * model and agent-browser leaves on it, so handing both a ready-made plan would
 * erase the difference being measured.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node bench/harness.mjs --arm sitelooper --model claude-sonnet-5 \
 *     --target repairdesk --task bench/tasks/repairdesk-ticket-flow.md \
 *     --runid bpX1 --out bench/results --reset
 *
 * --target selects the app under test and decides how --reset rolls it back.
 * It defaults to atelyr, the private app every published run so far used, so
 * that those command lines still reproduce. The repairdesk target ships in
 * this repo and needs nothing provisioned: start it with
 * `node bench/app/server.mjs` and the credentials default themselves.

/**
 * Three arm SHAPES, because the incumbents are not the same kind of thing:
 *
 *   cli         the orchestrator model calls one `run_command` tool wrapping
 *               the arm's own binary (sitelooper, agent-browser).
 *   mcp         the orchestrator model calls the arm's NATIVE tool set,
 *               served by an MCP server the harness spawns and proxies to.
 *               Playwright MCP is designed to be driven this way; wrapping it
 *               in a CLI would benchmark a shim nobody ships.
 *   monolithic  no orchestrator at all: the arm IS a complete agent. The
 *               harness hands it the task once and takes back the final
 *               report and token usage (browser-use). invocationCount is 1
 *               by construction and `turns` counts the agent's own steps.
 *
 * The controls that still hold across every shape: same task text, same
 * orchestrator model and provider where an orchestrator exists, same spend
 * accounting, same external verification. What CANNOT be held constant is the
 * loop shape itself — that difference is the thing being measured, exactly as
 * the layer-count difference is for cli arms (see file header).

So your job is to delegate an outcome and let that command run to its own report — not to drive the browser click-by-click. Give it one whole sub-goal per call — for example "create a record with these field values and report what the app computed", or "bring the item to «target state», discovering and satisfying any preconditions the app enforces, and report what was required" — and trust it to handle the intermediate steps itself. Do NOT split one sub-goal across several calls (one to open a form, another to fill it, another to submit); that interrupts an agent that would have finished the whole thing in a single call. Equally, do NOT spend a call just exploring or cataloguing the UI ("describe the app's structure", "open the dialog and list every field, option and button", "report the full contents") — that sends the agent on an open-ended survey that burns its whole budget without moving the goal forward.
