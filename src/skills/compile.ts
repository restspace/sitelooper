 * NOT in `startText` is text the procedure BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE, which is

 * cancelled, while "Cancelled" is listed only once it was.
 *
 * Everything here is a filter against FALSE POSITIVES, because a false
 * positive skips work that never happened while a false negative merely runs
 * the step as before:
 *  - text already in `startText` is not evidence of anything (it was true
 *    before);
 *  - an identity — a caller-vouched value, a minted id, a slot's recorded
 *    literal — names the RECORD, not its state, and is equally true before
 *    and after;
 *  - a line that still carries a `{{slot}}` after substitution cannot be
 *    checked against a live page without guessing what fills it;
 *  - and no startText, no report values, or a read-only procedure means no
 *    goal at all. Never guess one.
