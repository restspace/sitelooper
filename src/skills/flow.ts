 * cancelled) take the blame. The contradiction is visible at export time —
 * this reads it directly off the two instructions' report values, the same
 * way `noopStepWarning` reads a step's own report against its own pre-state.

 * be "contradicted" — there is nothing for the next read to disagree with),
 * and `j` must immediately follow `i` with no gap and be read-only by intent
 * (a second mutating step is expected to change what the first one did, so
 * comparing it would be noise, not a contradiction).
 *
 * Values are matched by label first (the natural case — the same field read

 * or state field, since an orchestrator's wording for the same field drifts
 * step to step ("order_status" vs "current_status"). Only the first line of

 * line each, so the first line is the CURRENT one and the rest is noise the
 * same way `alreadyShown` treats it. Containment either way counts as
 * agreement (a single-line report next to a status bar's fuller line, or a
