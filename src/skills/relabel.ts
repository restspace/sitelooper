/**
 * Post-session relabelling: one smart-model pass, at the end of a recording,
 * that renames poorly named report values before the flow is built.
 *
 * Every in-session naming mechanism — the read-time label, the report-time
 * ask, the selector-slug backfill — must name a value BEFORE anyone can know
 * whether it matters, because that is decided by instructions that have not
 * arrived yet. Session end is the one moment the whole story exists: which
 * values later instructions actually consumed, what the task called things,
 * and which names are selector slugs (`h1`, `role_radiogroup_aria_che`)
 * rather than words a person would write. fwod24 threaded its quotation
 * reference through eleven flow references as `02-create.h1` for want of
 * exactly this hindsight.
 *
 * The pass is safe by construction: it changes only the KEYS of
 * `evidence.values`. Slot discovery, `readLabel` and read-back pinning all
 * match by VALUE, so nothing the run banked can be lost — the failure mode
 * that forced mergeReportValues on the report-time retry cannot occur here.
 * And it is cheap where the in-session asks are not: one call per RECORDING,
 * amortised over every replay, with a payload of instruction texts and value
 * tables rather than the full turn history.
 *
 * It must run BEFORE buildFlow mints `{{step.name}}` references, and rename
 * the already-compiled skills in the same pass (step labels, reportTemplate
 * keys, `output:` binding keys) — a rename that touched the entries and not
 * the skills would recreate the dead-reference bug in a new costume.

 * The key is the name every replay publishes under and every later reference
 * spells, so a key carrying the recording's value is a frozen literal as
 * surely as a value would be.
 *
 * repairdesk fwrd86: 06-delete reported the archived row as
 * `list_row_RD-1015`. The VALUE was republished live on every replay
 * (`"list_row_RD-1015": "RD-1016 | …"` on n2), but the key kept n1's ticket, in
 * s_6532a2's reportTemplate, in the flow's outputs and in the compiled typed
 * output `06-delete.list_row_RD-1015`. The export's leak scan saw it
 * (`flow.steps[5].outputs[6]: "RD-1015" (output) in "list_row_RD-1015"`) and
 * only warned.
 *
 * Provenance decides, never the key's characters: `runValues` are values the
 * caller established this run made. The value comes out of the key as a whole
 * token (either case: model-chosen keys are usually lower-cased), with the
 * separators it leaves collapsed — `list_row_RD-1015` becomes `list_row`. A
 * name taken by another key of the same report gets `_2`, `_3`, …; a key that
 * WAS the value becomes `value`. Applied through the same machinery as the
 * model's relabel (entries, ledger, compiled skills), before buildFlow mints
 * any reference, so a later step's reference, the flow's outputs and the
 * compiled typed output all spell the new name.
