/**
 * The intermediate representation a compiled spec carries.
 *
 * It is a FLOW plus the converged procedures its steps resolved to, with
 * everything the emitted file cannot honour dropped: stats, status, the
 * structural fingerprint and the model that recorded it. Two reasons for it
 * to be its own shape rather than "a Flow and a store". First, the emitted
 * `.flow.ts` embeds this object verbatim as its FLOW constant, so it has to
 * be self-contained — a spec that resolved its skills out of `~/.sitelooper`
 * at run time would not be a Tier-2 artifact at all. Second, the store is
 * mutable and the file is a snapshot: pinning the procedure here is what
 * makes `lift(emit(spec))` the same IR every time, however the store has
 * moved on since.
