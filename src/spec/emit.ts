 * The IR as `@playwright/test` source (Tier 2: no sitelooper runtime).
 *
 * Two files, because they have two owners. `<name>.flow.ts` is the TOOL's:
 * every line of it is generated from the FLOW constant it carries, and
 * `repair` regenerates it wholesale, so a hand edit there is lost work.
 * `<name>.spec.ts` is the USER's: it is written once, never rewritten, and
 * it is where their own assertions live. Keeping the regenerated half and
 * the hand-written half in separate files is what lets convergence stay
 * automatic without ever clobbering a reviewer's work.
 *
 * What the emitted body must be is a faithful reading of `replay.ts`: the
 * same locator chain in the same order (see `./locators.js`), the same
 * effect gates as assertions, the same derived-value binding after the step
 * that mints it. Where Tier 2 cannot follow — a `point` candidate, the loop
 * cursor, the live measurement behind a fallback — it says so in a comment
 * instead of pretending, because a spec that asserts something the recording
 * never observed is worse than one that admits the gap.
