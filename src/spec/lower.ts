// spec-native runner. Lift gets a spec out of a `.flow.ts` file; lower gets
// it back INTO the store-and-flow world repair.ts, replay.ts and the CLI's
// `run` already operate on.
//
// This only has to be as faithful as `flowToSpec` is honest about being
// lossy: fingerprint, stats history, status history and the recording model
// are gone for good once a spec is emitted (ir.ts's header comment explains
// why), so lower manufactures fresh, conservative values for them rather
// than pretending to recover what was never carried. A compiled spec is by
// definition the converged output of a prior run, so `status: 'validated'`
// is not a guess — that is what "compiled" means.

/**
 * Rebuild one segment as a `Skill`.
 *
 * `id` and the procedure fields (template/params/preconditions/steps/derived)
 * are copied straight from the segment — those are exactly what `toSegment`
 * (ir.ts) kept, so copying them back is the whole round trip. Everything else
 * is bookkeeping `toSegment` deliberately drops and this function has to
 * invent: zeroed stats (a compiled spec carries no replay history), no
 * fingerprint (the emitted spec never had one to begin with — a live DOM
 * count vector needs a runtime, not a JSON literal), and a synthetic
 * provenance naming the spec as its own source rather than a recording
 * session.
 *
 * `seq` is set only when the step's procedure has more than one segment: a
 * single-segment skill in the wild never carries `seq` (see `Skill.seq` and
 * `chainOf` in ir.ts, which treats an absent `seq` as "this skill is its own
 * one-member chain"), and giving every skill a `seq` here would desync from
 * that. The chain id is the step's FIRST segment's id — stable, unique to
 * this step (segment ids are unique across a store), and exactly what
 * `chainOf` needs to find every member back by filtering the origin's skills
 * on `seq.chain`.
