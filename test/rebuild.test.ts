/**
 * The recording-path regression gate.
 *
 * `bench/sweep.mjs --from` can A/B a REPLAY change, because it reuses an
 * earlier recording. Nothing could A/B a RECORDING change: run 1 is
 * model-driven, so each sweep compiles a different procedure. fwod25 is what
 * that cost — 50 minutes, three cloud runs, and an unreadable answer, because
 * the recording bore no resemblance to the one it was being compared against.
 *
 * bench/fixtures/recordings holds real published `script.jsonl` files. Everything
 * after the model speaks is a pure function of them, so it can be replayed here
 * in a second, for free, and pinned. If a change to report.ts, learn.ts or
 * flow.ts alters what these recordings compile to, this test says so and names
 * the number that moved — before an hour of cloud time says it worse.
 *
 * A DIFF IS NOT A FAILURE. It is the measurement. When a change is meant to
 * move these numbers, read the diff, satisfy yourself it moved the right way,
 * then re-pin:
 *
 *   node bench/rebuild-flow.mjs --tag fwod24 --dir bench/fixtures/recordings \
 *     --baseline bench/fixtures/fwod24.json --write-baseline
