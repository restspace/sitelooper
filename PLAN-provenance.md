# Provenance: one ledger for everything the run itself made

Written 2026-08-28, after takes 5-8 of the v0.2 repairdesk sweep and the
fwgr6/fwod6 cloud runs. Successor to PLAN-replay-v2.md, which introduced
provenance for url-minted values; this generalises that mechanism and makes
it the ONLY way a run-scoped value reaches a replayable artifact.

## The evidence this plan rests on

Seven defects in six takes, all one family — a value or a procedure from the
RECORDING run surviving into a replay:

| where it leaked | symptom |
| --- | --- |
| read-back pinned to `tr:nth-of-type(1)` | replay published seed ref RD-1014 |
| runid inside a `scoped` anchor, un-slotted | anchor matched nothing, fell to positional |
| dashboard uid inside a skill TEMPLATE (62×) | n2 edited n1's dashboard |
| a sibling step's skill adopted by re-pin | two steps ran one read-only skill, mutated nothing, reported success |
| positional fallback kept after an anchor was dropped | published RD-1014 again, tier A, zero turns |
| `t15` below the 4-char minting floor | literal `#/tickets/t15` in six flow steps |
| session dir survived a restart | flow contained the task twice; both replays executed it twice |

Each was found by reading a drift file after a two-hour sweep, and each fix
was correct and narrow. The rate of discovery is not falling, and twice a fix
was incomplete in the same way: the rule it enforced already existed in two
or three other places (`flow.ts:175`, `flow.ts:466`, `freshUrlIds`), and
`canAdoptPin` guards the re-pin path while the export path grew the identical
defect independently. That is the signature of an invariant with no home.

## The invariant

> No value, identifier, or procedure belonging to the recording run may appear
> in a replayable artifact except as a binding that the next run re-resolves
> from its own evidence.

Artifacts: skill templates, step args, locator chains, expectations, report
templates, flow instructions, flow params, preconditions.

## Why the current design leaks

Run-scoped knowledge is threaded as **strings**, recovered by **text
matching**, gated by **shape heuristics** (`identifierLike`, `isIdLike`, a
minimum length, "does it occur in the instruction"). Three consequences:

1. Recognition is positional in the pipeline. `discoverSlots` can only slot
   what it can see in THIS instruction's text, so a uid minted two
   instructions ago is app furniture.
2. The gates are duplicated per call site, so a fix lands in one of three.
3. Substitution is post-hoc regex over already-built artifacts, which is why
   `replaceToken` needed guards against rewriting the inside of identifiers
   and of markers it had already placed (fwod5 shipped
   `{{02-create.o_{{01-open.url.q.view_type}}_view_o_group_tabl}}`).

## Mechanism: the RunLedger

One session-scoped registry. Every run-scoped value is entered ONCE, with
typed provenance saying how a later run re-derives it.

```ts
type Binding =
  | { from: 'var'; name: string }                              // caller declared it
  | { from: 'input' }                                          // the run typed it
  | { from: 'url'; step: StepRef; label: string }              // p1 | h0 | q.action
  | { from: 'output'; step: StepRef; name: string; path?: string } // report value / JSON leaf
  | { from: 'readback'; step: StepRef; spec: ElementSpec };    // re-read from the page

interface LedgerEntry {
  value: string;          // what it was on the recording run — EXAMPLE ONLY
  marker: string;         // {{v3}} / {{02-create.ref}}
  binding: Binding;
  kind: 'identifier' | 'name' | 'text';
  known: boolean;         // caller-vouched => usable as record identity
  firstSeen: { instruction: number; step: number };
}
```

`RunLedger` exposes exactly one predicate and one rewriter:

- `runValuesIn(text): LedgerEntry[]` — the single place any component asks
  "does this string carry something this run made?"
- `slot(text): SlottedString` — returns the text with markers substituted,
  boundary rules and marker-safety applied once, in one implementation.

Every producer consults it: `discoverSlots`, `buildFlow`'s referencizing,
`identityHints`, `urlPattern`, expectation building, report templating. The
heuristics survive only as *entry* criteria — deciding whether a newly seen
url part is worth banking is cheap to get wrong, because a missed entry costs
a model turn while a wrong one is caught by the scanner below.

## Mechanism: the ElementSpec

Match specs become one structure with typed roles, replacing the flat
candidate array whose ordering carried meaning implicitly:

```ts
interface ElementSpec {
  identity?: { container: string; text: SlottedString; within?: string };
  handles: Candidate[];   // testid | role+name | label | placeholder | text
  path?: Candidate;       // structural / nth — positional, last resort
  evidence: { urlPattern: string; fingerprint?: number[]; rowCells: string[] };
}
```

The rules that are currently spread across `candidatesFor`, `verifiedChain`,
`resolveChain`, `stranded` and the read-drop become properties of the type:

- `identity.text` is always slotted. An anchor that cannot be slotted is not
  an anchor — it never enters the spec.
- `identity` must resolve to exactly one element on the page that produced it.
- `path` is never sufficient for a spec whose purpose is to name a record: a
  read that publishes a ledger `identifier` and has no `identity` and no
  `handles` publishes nothing.
- Resolution order and the identity guard live in one resolver, with policy
  flags (`requireIdentity`, `allowMultiple`, `waitForRecord`) instead of
  positional convention.

## Run 1 to run N, end to end

**Run 1, instruction start.** Ledger seeded with caller vars (`runid`) as
`{from:'var'}` entries, `known: true`. Page url, fingerprint and visible text
captured as the segment's evidence.

**Run 1, before each action.** `prepare()` resolves the target to a handle and
describes it once. The ledger supplies the identity candidates: values present
in the element's row, narrowed to the cell that carries them, uniqueness-
checked against the live page. Handles come from testid/role/label/placeholder,
the structural path becomes `path`. **Every string entering the spec goes
through `ledger.slot()` at capture time** — parameterisation stops being a
later regex pass over finished artifacts.

**Run 1, after each action.** Anything the run just made is entered in the
ledger with its binding: a new url part (`{from:'url', step, label:'p1'}`), a
read-back value (`{from:'readback', step, spec}`), a JSON leaf of a response
the run read (`{from:'output', path:'dashboard.uid'}`), an identifier cited
only in the report's prose (pinned to the page, then `readback`). This is the
step that fixes grafana: the uid is banked when it appears, so the NEXT
instruction naming it slots it instead of embedding it.

**Run 1, compile.** Params are ledger entries, not rediscovered by scanning:
`example` is the recorded value, `binding` says how to get this run's own,
`known` decides identity. `requireText` is the subset of `known` identity
entries the page already showed at segment start.

**Run 1, export.** Flow steps carry markers and bindings. Then the **scanner**:
walk every artifact and assert no `ledger.runValuesIn(...)` hit survives
verbatim. A hit is a hard error naming the artifact, the value and its
binding — this is where t15, the uid, the stranded anchors and the duplicated
take all become one failing test instead of seven drift-file readings.

**Run N, step start.** A fresh ledger, seeded with run N's caller vars. Each
binding resolves against THIS run's evidence: `url` reads the live page's part
by label; `output` reads the value this run's earlier step published;
`readback` re-runs its ElementSpec against the live page; `input` takes the
caller's parameter. A binding that cannot resolve fails loudly — the step goes
to recovery with a stated reason, and never proceeds with a blank or a
recorded value.

**Run N, element location.** The resolver tries `identity` first, polling for
the record while the app paints (the deferred-refetch case), then `handles`,
then `path` only when the spec is not identity-bearing and the caller allows
it. Fallthroughs are counted as drift, as now.

## What this subsumes

`freshUrlIds` + the two duplicate length gates; `discoverSlots`'s three
recognition paths; `stranded`; the positional-read rule; `identityAnchor`'s
narrowing and uniqueness check; `derived` params; `jsonLeaves`;
`proseIdentifiers`; `provenanceValues` and `referencedValues` in the flow
runner. All become one entry path and one lookup.

Procedure identity is the same invariant one level up, so `canAdoptPin`'s two
rules generalise: a flow step owns its skill, and ownership is recorded in the
ledger rather than re-derived — which closes the export-side variant of the
defect that the re-pin gate already covers.

## Phases

1. **Ledger + scanner, no behaviour change.** Build the registry, populate it
   from today's producers, run the scanner in WARN mode over existing sweeps.
   It should immediately reproduce the seven known leaks; if it does not, the
   ledger is incomplete and that is the first thing to fix.
2. **Move recognition.** `discoverSlots` and `buildFlow` consult the ledger
   instead of their own heuristics. Delete the duplicate gates. Scanner to
   ERROR on export.
3. **Slot at capture.** `prepare()` slots strings as it builds them; the
   post-hoc `substitute` pass shrinks to the instruction template only.
4. **ElementSpec.** Collapse the candidate array into the typed structure and
   the single resolver.
5. **Verifier strictness** (independent, do first if cheap): extra mutations
   and extra created records fail a sweep instead of warning. fwrd16 scored
   6/6 while doing the task twice. **DONE 2026-09-10.** Every target now fails
   a run that did its work more than once, and the count is reported beside
   the objectives rather than as one of them, so the denominator the published
   matrices quote keeps its meaning:
   - repairdesk: duplicate part creates are a failed objective (they were a
     `WARNING` string appended to a PASS, while `hits[0]` picked one of the
     duplicates by accident); prior-run residue sets a non-zero exit instead
     of printing a note, because a sweep whose runs did not start from a
     common baseline is not a measurement. Duplicate tickets already failed.
   - grafana: two dashboards with the run's title fail. `titled[0]` used to
     pick one silently, and grafana mints a fresh uid per save, so a thrashing
     run left no trace inside any single dashboard — the count was the only
     place it showed.
   - kanboard: duplicate tasks fail, and so does a second comment carrying the
     runid — the extra-MUTATION half. Objective 4 passed on `some()` however
     many there were, so a retried step whose first attempt did land scored
     clean.
   - odoo needed no change: `orders.length === 1` is objective 2, and
     `lines.length === 2` is objective 3.

## The refusal bar (2026-09-10)

Refusing an export is the harshest thing the tool does — the recording goes to
`.rejected.json`, nothing replays it, and 20-50 minutes plus real model spend
is gone — and it was reachable from a regex. `fatal()` required only
`kind: 'identifier'` in a locator, and `kind` was decided by `looksLikeId` for
the largest population reaching the ledger (every value a step reported). An
app constant the model mentioned, standing as a step's only locator, binned the
run: `stripLeakedCandidates` skips a chain it would empty, so the leak survived
to the gate.

`LedgerEntry` now records the provenance of the KIND JUDGEMENT, not of the
value:

    basis: 'position' | 'var' | 'variance' | 'shape'

and `fatal()` returns false for `'shape'`. The location test moved out to
`inLocator()` so a REPORTER can keep the old bar: bench/verify-artifacts.mjs
now flags every identifier that reached a locator and names how many were
kinded by shape alone, because there a false positive costs a look rather than
a run — the same reasoning that had already moved the navigation-target rule
out of the product gate.

This does not leave a shape-based leak unattended. The flow exports with the
leak listed, and `stripLeakedCandidates` still deletes the candidate wherever
the chain survives without it; only the last-candidate case changes, from
refusal to warning. Nor is the gate permanently weaker — it is DEFERRED. Once
cross-run variance reaches the ledger, a value a later run lands differently on
carries `basis: 'variance'` and refuses again with evidence behind it. Run 1
warns and strips; run 2 refuses.

**Quarantine instead of rejection (2026-09-11).** A confident leak poisons
one step, but the export used to void the whole recording — and it left the
poisoned skill in the store, still matchable by the next instruction on that
page. Export now demotes every session skill with a fatal leak (which removes
it from candidate selection in learn.ts and replay.ts), unpins each flow step
that replays one — directly or through a segment chain, via the same
`unpinStep` that `sitelooper rerecord` uses — and writes a `leaked-step:`
warning onto the flow. The flow exports; the CLI prints an `error:` line per
quarantined step with the rerecord command; compile re-raises it as a
`needs-rerecord` error diagnostic. The quarantined step replays model-first
until a clean recovery earns a new pin. `saveRejectedFlow` has no caller left.

`known` was deleted in the same change. It recorded whether the run produced
the value — true of nearly everything banked, so it discriminated nothing — and
its doc claimed an invariant ("known values are the only ones allowed to carry
record IDENTITY") that no production code enforced: it was written by every
caller and read only by a test. `basis` is the distinction it was reaching for.

## Risks

- **Over-slotting.** A legitimate app constant that happens to equal a run
  value would be parameterised. Mitigated by requiring *provenance* for entry,
  not text equality: a value enters only when the run demonstrably produced it.
- **Bindings that cannot re-resolve.** Strictly better than today's silent
  wrong value, but it converts some passes into recoveries. The `readback`
  binding exists to keep that cost low.
- **Migration surface.** Phases 1-2 are additive and verifiable against the
  published sweeps in `bench/results-published/`; phases 3-4 touch the hot
  path and need the browser tests green at each step.
