# sitelooper

**Drive a web app from natural language once; replay it afterwards with no model in the loop.**

sitelooper is a Playwright CLI with an LLM agent inside it. You give it one instruction at a
time - "sign in as ops@example.com, create a ticket titled 'k7 Bench' and report its id" - and it
works the live browser for you, then hands back one structured, verified result. Nothing about
selectors, waits, dialogs or quoting reaches you or the outer agent that is calling it.

Then, every instruction that succeeds is compiled into a **stored procedure**, and a whole session can be exported as a **flow**. The next time the same job runs,
sitelooper replays the procedure deterministically — no model call, no tokens — and calls the
model only for a step the app has changed underneath. On the benchmark below, a converged flow
replays a seven-step ticket workflow in 17 seconds for $0.00, verified against what the app's own
database says happened.

> Package and command are both `sitelooper`. State lives under `~/.sitelooper/`, env vars are
> `SITELOOPER_*`. The project was previously called `sleep-walker`, and `browser-pilot` before
> that; both old command names, env-var prefixes and home directories still work as aliases.

## Why agent-driven browser automation does not rerun, and what sitelooper does about it

Ask any browser agent to do a job and it will, mostly. Ask it to do the same job tomorrow and you'll
be paying the price again: the model re-reads every page, re-decides every click, and costs
$1–1.50 per run on a dense app. The obvious fix - have the agent write a script from what it did -
doesn't work. The reasons are structural, and can't be fixed with a better prompt:

- **The run's own values are baked in.** The record it created has an id, the url has a uid, the
  title carries a run marker. A script quotes them literally, so on the next run it opens
  yesterday's record — or, worse, works a *different* record to completion and reports success.
- **The page changes every time.** Ids in class names, positional selectors
  (`tr:nth-of-type(3)`), a textbox named after the current minute, a heading that renders only
  after a scroll. What the agent clicked was right once; the selector it left behind names a
  position, not a thing.
- **The agent's waits were implicit.** Every observation turn was a pause the app needed. A
  script has no turns, so it runs ahead of a list that refetches a second later.
- **Nobody checks the effect.** A click can "succeed" on the wrong element. A save can be refused
  by a dialog the script never saw. Codegen replays report green while the database is untouched;
  in this benchmark the strongest static script verified 14 of 48 objectives and confirmed an
  empty sales order.

sitelooper's answer is to treat the recording as evidence to compile, not text to replay:

- **Durable locators with fallbacks.** Each action stores a chain of candidates — role and name,
  label, test id, a structural path last — and records which ones actually resolved on each replay,
  so a volatile candidate is retired by measurement, not by guesswork. A click on a table row is
  retargeted to the record's own link, whose name is its identifier. Each chain ends with where
  the element was: its box and the viewport. That box is the yardstick a positional guess is
  measured against, and, when every name has failed, the element at that point is taken as a last
  candidate only if it is the same kind of control. A locator, never a blind click.
- **Parameters, not literals.** Values you typed become slots. Values you *declared* (`var
  runid=k7`) become `{{runid}}`. A value one step read back and a later step used becomes
  `{{step.output}}`, threaded live between steps. A record id that first appeared in a url after a
  save is recognised as minted by this run and re-read from the browser on replay. What cannot be
  threaded is left blank and sent to recovery — never guessed.
- **Effect gates.** Every step records what changed on the page when it ran. On replay a step that
  ran but did not produce its recorded effect — the new title never appeared as a heading, an alert
  the recording never saw — stops the replay before the next step acts on the wrong state. An
  identity guard refuses to run a procedure on a page showing a different record than the one it
  was asked for.
- **Built for single-page apps.** The agent's observation turns were implicit waits; a replay has
  none, so every step first lets the DOM go quiet, and a navigation is given time to hydrate before
  its effects are checked. A click recorded to open a popup is skipped when that popup is already
  showing, because on a React toggle the same click would close it. A click that changed nothing
  at all while the recording shows an effect is retried once after the page settles. A fallback
  locator that resolves to a link leaving the app's origin is never taken.
- **A ladder, not a cliff.** Per step: replay the pinned procedure with zero model calls; if it
  cannot, recover on a cheap model with the partial replay in hand; escalate to the strong model
  only if that reports blocked; halt with per-step state only if that fails too. A recovery that
  validates is compiled and **re-pinned into the flow**, so a flow heals itself over runs.
- **Honest reports.** A replayed step reports only values it read back live or that came from your
  parameters. A value the recording captured as a literal is struck, never echoed from memory.
- **Nothing app-specific in the tool.** No selectors, gestures or workflow assumptions for any app
  live in sitelooper. App knowledge goes in a per-session briefing you supply; every mechanism
  above is described in terms any web app satisfies. This is the design boundary that keeps a fix
  for one app from being a hack for it.

## Getting started

Requires Node 20+, an installed Chrome or Edge (or `SITELOOPER_EXECUTABLE`), and an API key for
one OpenAI-compatible provider.

```sh
npm install -g sitelooper            # or, from a checkout: npm install && npm link
export NOVITA_API_KEY=...              # any preset: zhipu, novita, openrouter, openai (see Providers)
sitelooper config set provider novita
sitelooper doctor                    # node, browser, provider, key — no daemon needed
```

Drive a page:

```sh
sitelooper open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
sitelooper do "Add two todos: 'write the report' and 'send it'. Tick the first one off, then report how many items the footer counter shows as left."
```

`do` returns `{status, summary, evidence}`; the counter it reports was read back from the page.
Add `--verbose` to watch the agent, `--headed` to watch the browser.

Record a flow and replay it:

```sh
# 1. record: one --learn session, the caller deciding each step as it goes
sitelooper --session run1 --learn open http://app.local/
sitelooper --session run1 var runid=k7          # what will differ next time → {{runid}}
sitelooper --session run1 do "sign in as ops@example.com / {{env:APP_PASSWORD}} and create a ticket titled 'k7 Bench'; report its id"
sitelooper --session run1 do "on that ticket add a part 'k7 Part A' cost 100 markup 25; report the price"
sitelooper --session run1 stop --save-flow ticket-flow

# 2. replay: no caller, new value, fresh app
sitelooper run ticket-flow --var runid=m3 --progress
#   [OK] 01-signin  (replay)   ← pinned procedure, zero model calls
#   [OK] 02-add     (replay)
#   ticket-flow: 2/2 steps, 8s — success
```

### Compile to a Playwright spec

`sitelooper compile <flow-name-or-path> [--out <dir>] [--force]` takes a saved flow whose steps
have converged into stored procedures and emits two files: an owned `<name>.flow.ts` that carries
the flow as a `FLOW` constant plus one generated `async` step function per `FlowStep` (durable
locators, expectations, and parameter threading compiled to literal Playwright calls — no
sitelooper process, daemon, or model call involved), and a `<name>.spec.ts` scaffold that imports
`runFlow` and is written once and never touched again — it's yours to add assertions to. Re-running
`compile` regenerates the `.flow.ts` file (with `repair` able to patch it against a live page later)
but leaves an existing `.spec.ts` alone unless you pass `--force`.

Be honest about what this loses relative to a live `run`: this is Tier 2, compile-time only,
generated from the locator evidence a session already recorded — it does not measure anything
against the live page at compile time. A step whose stored procedure has no converged locator chain
compiles to a `throw` with a `TODO` rather than a guess, and `compile` exits 2 when any step is not
compilable. Point candidates (a last-resort click by screen position) are not expressible as a
Playwright locator and are dropped with a comment. And unlike `run`, a compiled spec has no runtime
recovery: if a locator has drifted since it was recorded, the spec fails outright instead of the
agent reasoning its way to the moved control — you get speed and zero cost per run in exchange for
giving up the LLM safety net.

`sitelooper flow list | show <name>` and `sitelooper skills list | show <id>` show what was
kept; flows are plain JSON under `~/.sitelooper/flows/`. A `run` prints per-step tier (A = zero
model), turns spent and drift tickets, and `--json` returns all of it.

**The loop.** Once compiled, the `.spec.ts` runs under plain `@playwright/test` — no sitelooper
process, no model, nothing but the two generated files and Playwright itself. Each locator call is
a `pick()` fallthrough over the candidates recorded at compile time, tried in recorded order; if
the primary misses and a later candidate resolves, that's drift, not failure — the test still
passes, but `pick()` prints a `[sitelooper drift] ...` line and appends it to the `.flow.ts`'s
exported `DRIFT` array, so a CI report or your own `.spec.ts` assertion can surface it without
grepping stderr.

When drift shows up (or the spec goes red outright), `sitelooper repair <name.flow.ts> --var k=v
[--converge n]` closes the loop: it lifts the owned file back to its IR, replays it against the
*live* app in an isolated temp store (never touching `~/.sitelooper`), and lets the recovery
ladder adapt it — a resolved fallback is promoted with a pure codemod, no model; a chain that's
gone dead gets one new locator proposed and verified by the model on the live page; a segment that
needs re-recording is reported, never attempted. It then prints a reviewer-readable change list
("candidate promoted", "new locator", "chain reordered"), and only if `--converge n` further real
runs come back as clean tier-A replays with no drift does it rewrite the `.flow.ts` — the
`.spec.ts` is never touched. A record-creating flow needs a fresh identity each of those runs;
`{n}` in a `--var` value is replaced by the run number (`--var runid=fix-{n}` becomes `fix-0`,
`fix-1`, ...). That gives each run its own records but not its own *app* — everything the
previous run left behind is still there — so `--reset-cmd "<shell command>"` runs a command of
your choosing before run 1 and before every converge run (`--reset-cmd "curl -s -X POST
http://127.0.0.1:4180/__reset"`). It runs through a shell and a non-zero exit aborts the
repair: a converge pass over an app that was not reset is a verdict about nothing.

Repair also folds each run's evidence back into the chains as a pure codemod, no model: a
candidate that has never resolved and has now missed on two runs is sorted to the *back* of its
chain and reported as `candidate retired: <expr> — missed 2 run(s), never hit; now last`.
Evidence outranks kind, with one exception — a structural css path never floats over an
identity or handle candidate that has actually resolved. Once a candidate is retired this way
the fallthrough that names it stops counting against `--converge`: the spec now records that
fact, so re-observing it is not new drift. Without that rule one chronically volatile locator
keeps the gate from ever clearing.

One thing `repair` cannot see on its own: every gate above runs the *IR* through the daemon, so a
defect in the **emitter** — a locator that lowers fine for replay and transpiles to a Playwright
call that never resolves — passes convergence and still ships a red spec. (That is exactly what
happened on kanboard: "converged, 5/5, no changes", file written, spec failing deterministically
under plain Playwright.) `--check-spec` closes it: after the owned file is written, the sibling
`.spec.ts` is run **once** under plain `@playwright/test` — a minimal generated config, headless,
one worker, 60 s per test, `--var` values passed in as `process.env.<VAR>` the way the scaffold
reads them, the same `--reset-cmd` first — and the JSON report is turned into one line:

```
spec check: passed in 8 s, 0 drift
spec check: FAILED at @step 01-open s_8d7c18/2 — Error: none of 1 recorded locators resolved:
getByTestId('field-nonsense-broken') — this is an emitter defect, not drift: the live replay
passed this step
```

A failed check does **not** un-write the file — the repair may well have adapted the locator
correctly, and the diff is still yours to review — but the exit code becomes `4`. When
`@playwright/test` can't be resolved from the project the check says so and is skipped, never
failed. The same run is available on its own as `sitelooper check <name.flow.ts> --var k=v
[--reset-cmd "<cmd>"] [--json]`, which needs no daemon and no model; `--json` puts the whole
verdict under `specCheck`, in `repair`'s report too.

Exit codes matter here: `2` means the file was hand-edited or otherwise refused outright (not a
sitelooper flow file, or a missing `--var`); `3` means the repair itself worked but the convergence
gate didn't hold; `4` means it converged and the file was written but the emitted `.spec.ts` failed
its `--check-spec` run; `1` covers both "the repair would have dropped an expectation" (refused — an
assertion that no longer holds is a test failure for a human, not drift) and "nothing could be
repaired without re-recording". The intended workflow is a pull request, not a background daemon:
CI runs the spec and fails loud on drift; a developer, or a scheduled agent picking up the failure,
runs `repair` and opens the diff for review.

  ...

  spec check: passed in 8 s, 0 drift
```

Be honest about what the loop still doesn't give back, even after `repair`: this stays Tier 2 —
point candidates (a last-resort click by screen position) are still unexpressible and dropped at
compile time; there's no live chain measurement, so the spec learns from a run only when `repair`
is invoked, never continuously; there's no loop cursor across records; and a moved control still
fails the *run that discovered it* before repair can act — recovery in a compiled spec is a
follow-up PR, never a live save.

**Sizing an instruction.** One `do` is one logical, verifiable step: a goal plus the check that it
worked. Several UI actions inside one instruction is normal — that is the point. Too big (several
unrelated goals) stalls on planning; too small (one click) pays an agent loop for what `peek` gives
free.

**Briefing.** Everything the DOM will not tell an agent about your app goes in a page of markdown
loaded with `brief <file.md>`: where things are, house conventions ("Apply only previews, Save
persists"), credentials as `{{env:NAME}}` markers, what not to touch.

## Current matrix

Two questions decide whether the tool earns its place. **First contact**: given a goal it has
never seen, how does sitelooper compare with the incumbents? **Every run after that**: once the
flow is known, what does repeating it cost, and does it stay correct? Success is always the
app-side verifier's count (mutation log, JSON-RPC or HTTP API state), never an arm's self-report.
All cells are cloud runs on identical hardware, one box per target; full detail in
[bench/MATRIX-SUMMARY.md](bench/MATRIX-SUMMARY.md).

**Matrix 1 — first contact.** sitelooper: set 26 (2026-09-03, build e048128; glm-5.3
orchestrator, deepseek-v4-flash inner with glm-5.3 escalation). agent-browser: set 17, same era,
glm-5.3.

| target | sitelooper | agent-browser |
|---|---|---|
| repairdesk (in-repo SPA) | 7/7 · $0.07 · 1212s (set 28; set 26: 7/7 · $0.09 · 819s) | 6/6 · $0.19 · 67s |
| kanboard (PHP, drag-and-drop) | 6/6 · $0.21 · 1078s (set 28; set 26: 6/6 · $0.04 · 385s) | **2/6 (turn-cap)** · $0.77 · 118s |
| grafana (React SPA) | 6/6 · $0.14 · 1381s (set 28; set 26: 6/6 · $0.48 · 2037s) | 6/6 · $1.05 · 448s |
| odoo (dense CRUD) | 6/6 · $0.38 · 1451s (set 28d; set 26: 6/6 · $0.59 · 1651s) | 6/6 · $1.51 · 302s |
| atelyr (private React app, local) | 2/2 checkable · $0.76 · 2557s (set 28e; set 28: 6 reported, 2/2 checkable · $1.43 · 3043s) | — |

On first contact sitelooper is the slowest arm on every target, by design: it drives a cheap
inner model and spends the extra time recording verified locators, value provenance and effect
expectations. What that buys is the lowest cost on every target (2–19× cheaper), a 25/25 objective
record including the board that turn-capped agent-browser at 2/6, and the recording that makes
Matrix 2 exist.

**Matrix 2 — every run after the first.** The same four flows repeated: sitelooper replays (set
24, two replays each) against re-running the agent, against a Playwright script the agent authored
from its own run, against literal codegen from the recording, and against **Tier 2 spec** — the
same recording compiled by `sitelooper compile` into a standalone `@playwright/test` spec with no
sitelooper runtime in the loop at all, then replayed under the real Playwright test runner
(`bench/spec-replay.mjs`).

| target | sitelooper replay (r1, r2) | agent re-run | authored script | codegen | Tier 2 spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| repairdesk | **7/7, 7/7** · $0.00, $0.00 · 24s, 23s (set 28) | 6/6 · $0.19 · 67s every time | 1/6, 1/6 · $0 | 6/6, 6/6 · $0 | **6/6** · $0.00 · 9s (fwrd42 store, sprd5; 48 assertions, 10-entry mutation log) |
| kanboard | **4/4 checkable, same** · $0.00, $0.00 · 23s, 23s (set 28; two objectives are report-based and a zero-model replay writes no report) | 2/6 · $0.77 · 118s every time | 5/6, 5/6 · $0 | 4/4 (+2 n/a) · $0 | not yet run |
| grafana | **6/6, 6/6** · $0.00, $0.00 · 47s, 47s (set 28, zero model turns); set 26 as recorded: 5/6, 5/6 · $0.18, $0.55 · 661s, 1864s | 6/6 · $1.05 · 448s every time | 0/6, 0/6 · $0 | 0/6, 0/6 · $0 | not yet run |
| odoo | **6/6, 6/6** · $0.03, $0.00 · 664s, 243s (set 28d; the create step at tier A on both replays) | 6/6 · $1.51 · 302s every time | 1/6, 1/6 · $0 | 0/6, 0/6 · $0 | not yet run |
| atelyr | 12/12 flow steps · $0.13, $0.43 · 710s, 1002s (set 28e; 114 then 134 model turns; nine of twelve steps at zero turns on the second replay, the three re-pinned steps among them) | — | — | — | not yet run |

**Tier 2 spec, status.** `bench/spec-replay.mjs` compiles a published flow + skill store
(`sitelooper compile <flow> --out <tmp>` with `SITELOOPER_SKILLS_DIR` pointing at the store) and
runs the emitted `<name>.spec.ts` under `npx playwright test`, scored by the same app-side
verifiers as every other arm (`<tag>-spec-result.json`, `arm: "spec"`). Repairdesk is run:
`bench/results-published/flows/fwrd42.json` (reconstructed from the published fwrd42 store and
flowrun) compiled against `fwrd42-skills` and verified 6/6 by `verify-repairdesk.mjs` with the
clean-run mutation log. The other targets are cloud-hosted and not yet run.

Set 24 also caught two engine regressions of its own (kanboard's replays at 22 and 37 turns
where set 15 needed none; grafana's replays losing objective 1 and recovering one step at 19 and
44 turns). Every cause was a testable engine rule — a clock-stamped textbox name in an
expectation, a trailing space in an identity marker, an expectation-only value promoted to a
required parameter, a heading that renders only on scroll — and all are fixed on build f727c89.
The clean A/B is to replay the same set-24 flows and stores on the fixed build (set 24b):

| target | set 24 replays (b9ccbca) | set 24b replays (f727c89) |
|---|---|---|
| kanboard | 22 and 37 turns · 272s, 555s | **0 and 0 turns · 56s, 56s** · 4/4 app-state objectives both |
| grafana | 4/6, 5/6 · 19 and 44 turns | **6/6, 6/6** · 29 and 44 turns · 151s, 272s on 08cf104, with the same recording's flow re-exported by the fixed engine (one export rule needed that) and paired with its replay-refined store |
| odoo (set 26 recording) | 6/6, 6/6 · 91 and 35 turns | **6/6 · 31 turns · 213s** on 6ad5cde with the same pairing; the rest is the app's own url state varying between runs |

The grafana row shows the shape of most of this work: the set-24 grafana
cell as recorded was 4/6 and 5/6, and each miss was a rule in the engine
(a read discounted as an echo of a recorded scroll; a flow that referenced
a typed value as another step's output). Fixing the rules and re-exporting
the same recording gives 6/6 on both replays. Fresh recordings since then
(fwgr24, fwgr25, fwgr26) each added a rule of the same kind — an accidental
"Discard changes?" dialog, a dialog opened and cancelled, transient status
and alert lines — until fwgr26 compiled clean and instead lost every replay to an
error page. Five runs were spent finding out why: the sign-in skill carried
a recorded stray click on a `target=_blank` link to grafana.com, the box has
no network, the new tab landed on a browser error page, and the daemon
adopted that tab as the page to work on. The replay now keeps its page
whatever tabs open, a tab that lands on an error page is closed, and a
fallback that resolves to a link leaving the recorded origin is never
taken. Full detail, including the
runs that did not work, is in [bench/MATRIX-SUMMARY.md](bench/MATRIX-SUMMARY.md).

Reading it: static scripts are free and mostly wrong; re-running the agent is reliable and costs
the full price forever; sitelooper's repeat cost trends to zero without the correctness trending
anywhere, and where it does not, the cause has so far always been a specific engine rule rather
than the app.

| `zhipu` (default) | `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4` | `glm-5.2` | — | `GLM_API_KEY` / `ZHIPU_API_KEY` |
| `novita` | `https://api.novita.ai/openai` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | `zai-org/glm-5.3` | `NOVITA_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `z-ai/glm-5.2` | — | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |

Every field resolves **flag > env > config file > preset**: `--provider`, `--model`,
`--base-url`, `--fallback-model`; `SITELOOPER_PROVIDER`, `SITELOOPER_MODEL`,
`SITELOOPER_FALLBACK_MODEL`, `SITELOOPER_BASE_URL`, `SITELOOPER_API_KEY`;
`sitelooper config set <provider|model|fallbackModel|baseUrl|apiKey> <value>` →
`~/.sitelooper/config.json`. Prefer env for the key. The benchmark stack is
`SITELOOPER_PROVIDER=openrouter`, model `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, fallback `z-ai/glm-5.3`.

**Escalation on blocked.** An instruction the routine model reports as `blocked` is retried once
on the escalation model, on the same browser and history, told it is resuming so it re-checks
state before repeating anything that could double-apply. A verified `failure` is not retried, nor
is an operator stop. Both attempts are billed into the returned `turns` and `usage`; the report's
`escalation` object says whether the retry rescued it. `--no-escalate`, or a fallback model of
`none`, turns it off.

### Configuration

| Env / flag | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `SITELOOPER_CHANNEL` | `chrome` → `msedge` → bundled | browser channel |
| `SITELOOPER_EXECUTABLE` | — | explicit browser binary |
| `SITELOOPER_HEADED=1`, `--headed` | headless | visible window (first call of a session) |
| `SITELOOPER_HOME` | `~/.sitelooper` | sessions, skills, flows, config |
| `SITELOOPER_SKILLS=1`, `--learn` | off | learning mode; `SITELOOPER_SKILLS_DIR` relocates the store |
| `SITELOOPER_FLOWS_DIR` | `~/.sitelooper/flows` | flow files |
| `SITELOOPER_RECORD=1`, `--record` | off | webm per tab; paths printed by `stop` |
| `SITELOOPER_SCRIPT=1`, `--script` | off | record every action as a replayable Playwright step |
| `--max-turns` | 30 | agent turn cap per instruction |
| `--timeout` | 300 | wall-clock seconds per instruction |
| `--turn-timeout` | 90 | seconds for one LLM call before it is aborted and nudged |

### What the outer agent sees

`do` prints a one-line result, or with `--json` the full
`{report: {status, summary, details?, evidence?}, turns, usage, model}`. On a turn or time cap
the result also carries `actions`, the ordered tool calls that ran, so a caller can verify state
before resuming rather than repeat a mutation. Nothing else lands in the caller's context: the
agent's snapshots, retries and tool chatter stay inside the daemon.

### What it will not do

- **Canvas-rendered content** (charts, drawn grids, images) has no DOM to read or verify; the
  agent reports blocked and says so.
- **Anti-bot evasion, CAPTCHA solving, crawling** are out of scope. sitelooper is for testing
  and driving apps you operate or are authorised to test.
- **Vision**: the agent is text-only; it reads the accessibility tree and DOM. Screenshots are
  for you.
- **Guessing credentials**: a rejected or missing credential is an immediate blocked report,
  never a retry loop. `{{env:NAME}}` markers are how you supply them.

### Claude Code skill

`skills/sitelooper/SKILL.md` is the canonical copy of the bundled skill:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/sitelooper
cp skills/sitelooper/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/sitelooper/SKILL.md
```

### Development

```sh
npm run build                         # tsc -> dist/
npm test                              # unit tests
BP_BROWSER_TESTS=1 npx vitest run     # + browser-backed replay and perturbation tests (needs Chrome/Edge)
```

The recording-path regression gate (`test/rebuild.test.ts`) recompiles real published
recordings and pins what they compile to; it runs the built engine, so build before testing.
Benchmark procedure, arms, targets and the cloud runbook live under `bench/`.
